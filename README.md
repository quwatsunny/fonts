There are two fonts available in the repository, but we recommend the Burushaski Quwatz Yasin font, as extensive work has been done to fine-tune it, ensuring it comprehensively supports all aspects of the Burushaski Perso-Arabic orthography.
The Burushaski Quwatz Nastaliq Font still needs a lot of work. It may work 95% of the times.
